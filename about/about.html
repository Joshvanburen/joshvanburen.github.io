		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I always had an interest in technology and gadgets. So, when I went to college, 
		Computer Science seemed like a natural fit for me. I started with Java and never
		looked back. I graduated in 2007 from the University of South Carolina at Aiken 
		with honors and a degree in Math and Computer Science.</p>
		<p>At that point, I wanted to continue my education. So, I decided to pursue a 
		master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of South
		Carolina at Columbia. It was one of the best decisions that I have ever made. 
		I learned so much in those two years that made me a better developer and computer
		scientist in general. I graduated in 2009 with a M.E. in Computer Science and 
		Engineering.</p>
		<p>During my summers, I interned for the Department of Energy at the Savannah
		River Site near my home in Aiken, SC. After I graduated in 2009, they wanted to 
		keep me around and offered me a job with the Desktop Systems Team.</p>
		<p>This was a new experience for me, going from mainly being a developer to 
		being a systems administrator. However, I believe being a developer has helped
		me to also be a great systems administrator because I can look at a problem 
		from a variety of angles. I've had to learn a lot of skills and fill a lot of 
		roles including developer, group policy expert, patch manager, and too many 
		others to name. I still get to do quite a bit of development in various languages 
		including C, C++, Perl, JavaScript, Python, Powershell, VBScript, and others. 
		Currently, I'm the System Center Configuration Manager administrator. As the 
		SCCM admin, I perform a lot of tasks including software update configuration 
		and deployment, operating system configuration and deployment, and report 
		management. One of the things that I'm most proud of is that I designed and 
		implemented an operating system deployment process that migrated almost 9000 
		PC's from Windows XP to Windows 7.</p>
		<h1>Tools</h1>
		<p>I generally prefer open source or freeware tools and want to highlight some of them.</p>
		<p>My preferred text editor on Windows is Notepad++ and KATE on Linux. Currently, my 
		favorite Linux distribution is Mint. I also prefer to have some Linux tools available 
		on Windows so I will either install MSYS or use GNU on Windows (GOW). Most of the time, I 
		do not use and IDE, but when I do, I will use SharpDevelop, CodeBlocks, or Visual Studio.</p>
		<p>As far as languages, I look at whatever the task or project is and try to pick the 
		language that best fits.</p>
