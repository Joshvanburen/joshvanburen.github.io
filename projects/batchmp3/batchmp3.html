			<h1>Batch Rename of MP3 Files</h1>
			<p>I have a large collection of music in mp3 format and was not always disciplined in naming the files.
			Eventually, this became really annoying and I wanted a tool to read the mp3 tag data on the files and rename them
			to whatever convention that I wanted.  None of the programs I looked at were lean and just did that job.  So, I 
			decided to write my own.  I used the <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org">WxWidgets</a> library for the GUI and the <a href="http://taglib.github.io">Taglib</a> 
			library to read the mp3 data. You can download the source code and the executable <a href="https://github.com/Joshvanburen/batchmp3">here</a>.</p>
