			<h1>Batch Rename of MP3 Files</h1>
			<p><img src="batchmp301.jpg" alt="Batch MP3 Rename" class="imgFloatLeft"/>I have a large collection of music in mp3 format and was not always disciplined in naming the files.
			Eventually, this became really annoying and I wanted a tool to read the mp3 tag data on the files and rename them
			to whatever convention that I wanted.  None of the programs I looked at were lean and just did that job.  So, I 
			decided to write my own.  I used the <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org">WxWidgets</a> library for the GUI and the <a href="http://taglib.github.io">Taglib</a> 
			library to read the mp3 data. You can download the source code and the executable <a href="https://github.com/Joshvanburen/batchmp3">here</a>.</p>
			<h1>Timed Shutdown</h1>
			<p><img src="timedshutdown01.jpg" alt="TimedShutdown" class="imgFloatLeft"/>I like to save energy and power and don't like to leave my computer on 
			any more than I have to. So, I don't like to keep it on all night. 
			If I have a task running or a download going, I like to have the computer shut down at some point. I got tired of manually typing out 
			the command line. So, I wrote an executable to do it for me. I used the <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org">WxWidgets</a> library for the GUI. 
			You can download the source code and the executable <a href="https://github.com/Joshvanburen/timedshutdown">here</a>.</p>
