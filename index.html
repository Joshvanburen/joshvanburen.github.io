		<p>I'm Josh. I'm a developer and systems administrator with a deep enthusiasm for technology.</p>
		<p>I currently work as the SCCM Administrator as a member of the Desktop Systems team at the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in Aiken, SC. In
		addition to being the SCCM administrator, I package applications using InstallShield, program and script using various languages including C, C++, 
		Powershell, VBScript, Visual Basic, and other languages. As the SCCM administrator, I also created an operating system deployment (OSD) process
		that was used to migrate over 8500 PC's from Windows XP to Windows 7. I am the main OSD specialist as well. I've also worked with application 
		deployment, software updates, reporting, queries, and almost every other area.</p>
